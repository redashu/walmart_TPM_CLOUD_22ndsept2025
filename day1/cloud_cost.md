# 💸 Cloud Costs & Pricing Models

### CapEx vs OpEx (Walmart Analogy):

- **CapEx (Capital Expenditure):**  
  Buying physical servers upfront → like Walmart building its own warehouses.

- **OpEx (Operational Expenditure):**  
  Renting cloud → pay monthly for what you use, like renting trucks only during holiday rush.

### Pricing Models

#### 1. Pay-as-you-go (On-Demand)
- Flexible, but most expensive per unit.
- **Use:** Short-lived apps, dev/test.

#### 2. Reserved Instances
- Commit for 1–3 years → cheaper.
- **Use:** Predictable workloads like HR, payroll, always-on databases.

#### 3. Spot Instances (Preemptible VMs in GCP)
- Cheapest, but can be terminated anytime.
- **Use:** Non-critical batch jobs (e.g., ML training overnight).
