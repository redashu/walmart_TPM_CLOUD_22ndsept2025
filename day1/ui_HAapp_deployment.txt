1. User base location is : Japan 
2. Need to Deploy only UI app 
    i)  OS in vm (which one to choose ) ? win10 / win 2019 
    ii) RAM , cpu , HDD 
    iii) app server (which one to choose) {IIS,nginx,httpd,tomcat etc}
    iv) firewall rules to allow user to access app 
3. start gcp region based compare 
4. HA (just creating a sinle vm is not enough ) (at least 2 vm selection)
5. to balance traffic in both the vm we need LoadBalancer 

==> final cost gonna be 
i) OS type , app server type 
ii) region {choose zones for each vm}
iii) LoadBalancer 

===after this let me know the costing
